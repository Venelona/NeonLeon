-----Leonardo-----


This is the ghost/ukagaka of Future Leonardo, based on  TV series and a movie Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles by Nickelodeon. WARNING - this thing is loaded with headcanons and subpar writing that might be seen as OOC to some people. Leonardo is pretty friendly, using the time he's stuck in your computer as a break from his duties. He doesn't mind keeping you company or answer your questions, but he can get upset over what you choose to ask him...

Leonardo can do most standard Ghost functions, such as...

-fixing your system's clock
-emptying your recycle bin
-checking if you have new email (if you set your POP settings properly)
-setting an image as your desktop wallpaper

and he will also say random bits of dialogue as he loafs around your computer, though you can change the frequency of that in his config menu if you want him to talk more or less. WARNING - this is LOADED with spoilers for the WHOLE 2018 show and the 2022 movie.

You can ask Leonardo questions, give him something every day, inquire about his family and friends, and even learn about his most traumatic experiences, including what happened to folks that are no longer around! If he grows to like you and trust you enough, that is.

You can pet his head via stroking the top of his head with your mouse cursor. Don't be surprised if he gets embarrassed about it, though.

The longer you know him and more you talk to him, the more he will grow to know you. As the time goes on, he may start to say new things, and, depending on what he reveals, give more answers to questions. You can check on his mood through the stat screen in the menu, and you can also reset him if you want to undo what he knows of you. 

Be warned that some things can't be completely erased though...
